Facial Expression Recognition (FER) for Mental Health Detection Using Transformer Model
Overview of Facial Expression Recognition Techniques Using Python
Mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), and other conditions significantly impact individuals and society. Early detection and intervention can drastically improve outcomes, and Facial Expression Recognition (FER) provides a non-invasive and efficient way to monitor emotional states.

This repository combines Artificial Intelligence for Mental Health with advanced Facial Emotion Recognition techniques to identify subtle changes in expressions that indicate mental health risks. The project leverages cutting-edge models, including Swin Transformers, Vision Transformers (ViT), and Custom CNNs, integrated with robust datasets such as FER2013 and CK+. These models are designed to:

Recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
Detect early signs of mental health conditions such as serious mental illness and stress-related disorders.
Provide practical applications in AI Emotion Recognition for healthcare, HR, and research.
Key Features:

High-accuracy emotion detection using deep learning for facial expression recognition.
Integration with mental health scoring systems to quantify emotional health.
Applications in real-time emotion detection systems and emotion detection using OpenCV Python.
